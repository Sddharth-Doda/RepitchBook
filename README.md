# REPitchBook AI – Insights Platform

REPitchBook AI is an **AI-powered real estate deal analysis platform** that helps investors, brokers, and real estate professionals evaluate property opportunities with clarity and confidence.

Instead of just generating pitch decks or static reports, REPitchBook AI focuses on **investment reasoning** — combining market intelligence, financial modeling, and risk analysis to produce actionable insights for real-world real estate decisions.

## Key Features

* **AI Deal Analysis** – Automatically evaluates real estate deals using financial metrics and market signals.
* **Hyperlocal Market Insights** – Considers location-level trends, pricing signals, and demand indicators.
* **Risk Scoring** – Identifies red flags, uncertainties, and downside risks in a deal.
* **Investor-Ready Insights** – Outputs structured insights that can be directly used for investor discussions.
* **Modern Frontend** – Clean, responsive UI built with modern frontend tools.

## What Makes This Different?

Most platforms focus on *presentation*. REPitchBook AI focuses on *reasoning*.

Instead of asking *“How does this look?”*, the platform answers:

* Is this deal actually worth investing in?
* What assumptions are risky?
* Where does this deal outperform or underperform the market?
